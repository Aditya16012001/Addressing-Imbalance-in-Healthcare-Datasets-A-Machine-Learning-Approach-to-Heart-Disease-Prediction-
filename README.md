This project focuses on addressing the issue of class imbalance in healthcare datasets, particularly in the context of predicting heart disease. The dataset used in this project is derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The study evaluates the performance of machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost. 

Various data preprocessing steps like feature engineering and sampling techniques (e.g., random under-sampling, near miss, and cluster centroids) were employed to improve prediction accuracy and reliability, particularly for the minority class. The performance of the models was measured using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, which are critical for healthcare applications.

Key features of the project include:

Application of under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance.

Model tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.

Evaluation of model performance using healthcare-relevant metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).

Visualizations for exploratory data analysis and model interpretation.

This project contributes to more reliable machine learning applications in healthcare, improving the detection of heart disease through better handling of imbalanced data.
